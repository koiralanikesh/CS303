# CS303 Assignment #1 Question #2
In this assignment, we were asked to write a program comparing the value of y1 and y2.
The value of y1 and y2 was defined.
We were supposed to compare y1 and y2 up to 100 with an increment of 10.
I have created two folders inside question 2.
The first folder contains the source cpp file.
The second folder has an image of the output.
